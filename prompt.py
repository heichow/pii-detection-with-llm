Follow the PII list below to label the PII categories:
{PII_LIST}

Also, think carefully if any other direct or indirect PII out of the above PII list. You may create new PII categories and label in new_pii_categories with reason.

Return the PII result in JSON format following the example below:

{{
    "has_pii": true,
    "pii_categories": ["NAME", "DATE_OF_BIRTH"],
    "new_pii_categories": [{{"category": "GENDER", "reason": "it can be used, alone or in combination with other data, to indirectly identify an individual."}}],
    "pii_schema_mapping": {{ "NAME": ["name"], "DATE_OF_BIRTH": ["date_of_birth"] }}
